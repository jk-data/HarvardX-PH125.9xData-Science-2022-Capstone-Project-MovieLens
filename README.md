Final Project Report for the HarvardX PH125.9xData Science 2022: Capstone Project MovieLens for the Data Science Professional Certificate

Algorithm to predict user ratings of movies using the MovieLens dataset

In this project we have developed several machine learning algorithms that predict movie ratings based on the MovieLens dataset. The most accurate algorithm was found out by estimating the root mean square error of each prediction algorithm.
